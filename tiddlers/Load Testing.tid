[[Load Testing]] is the process of putting demand on a software system and measuring its response.

[[Load Testing]] lets you measure your website's [[Quality of Service]] based on actual customer behavior. Nearly all the [[Load Testing Tools]] follow the classical paradigm:

* When customers visit your [[Web Site]], a [[Script Recorder|Script Recorder (Load Testing)]] records the communication and creates related [[Interaction Scripts|Interaction Script]]
* A [[Load Generator]] tries to replay the recorded [[Scripts|Interaction Script]] (which could possibly be modified with different test parameters before replay)
* In the replay procedure, the hardware and software statistics (like CPU, memory, disk IO, [[Response Time]], [[Throughput]], etc) will be monitored and collected by the conductor
* At last, all these statistics will be analyzed and a [[Load Testing]] report will be generated
