Sounds like a politically correct version of "multi-master".

ChatGPT begs to disagree tho, emphasizing that multi-master is an older concept that means multiple nodes in a cluster can access writes, while multi-active means multiple //regions// can accept writes (which of course implies nodes too), but generally it's more about global infra than it's about details of cluster operation, because those are abstracted away in a managed db like [[DynamoDB]] (which is where i've first heard about "multi-active" in the first place).

Although all this could really just be hallucinations. You see, [[DynamoDB]] is described as "multi-region, multi-active", where, logically, the "global infra" part is covered by "multi-active", leaving only what's known as "multi-master" to the "multi-active" part of this slogan.
