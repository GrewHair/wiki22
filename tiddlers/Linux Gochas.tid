* Issuing the `groups` command is supposed to show you the groups you're a member of. However, if there are spaces in their names (which is often the case in companies), you won't be able to distinguish a delimiting space from a 'meaningful' space (because `groups` doesn't have a flag to change delimiter). Use this instead:
*>`id -Gnz | tr '\0' '\n'` - it uses the [[Null Character]]
