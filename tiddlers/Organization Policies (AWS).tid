When you first learn about [[AWS Organizations]] in your "for dummies" AWS course, they tell you about this [[SCP|Service Control Policies]] thingie, presenting them as //the// type of policies that have to do with organizations.

What do you know, [[SCPs|Service Control Policies]] are in just one kind (if the most popular and practical one) of [[Organization Policies|Organization Policies (AWS)]]!!

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com

You live your life and don't touch anyone, until you stumble upon a policy like this:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": {
        "Sid": "AlloworgsReadonlyAndIamGetReport",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "iam:GetOrganizationsAccessReport",
          "organizations:Describe*",
          "organizations:List*"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
        "Sid": "AllowGenerateReportonlyForThePolicy",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "iam:GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport",
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {
            "StringeEquals": {"iam:OrganizationsPolicyId": "p-policyl23"}
        }
    }
}
```

with an explanation like:

```
For those accounts that are members of an AWS Organizations unit, this condition key provides the IAM entity access to specific SCPs. 

The example shown here is an IAM policy that allows viewing service last accessed information for SCP with the p-policy123 ID. This policy also allows the requester to retrieve the data for any Organizations entity in their organization.
```

But there's not a word about [[SCPs|Service Control Policies]] in the policy document at all. Wonder why? Now you know why.
