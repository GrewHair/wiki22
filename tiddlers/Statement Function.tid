[[Statement Function]] is a combination of a [[Predicate|Predicate (Predicate Logic)]] with a [[Variable|Variable (Predicate Logic)]].

Example:

[[A|Predicate (Predicate Logic)]][[x|Variable]][[â†’|Material Implication]][[B|Predicate (Predicate Logic)]][[x|Variable]]

It is basically a [[Statement|Statement (Predicate Logic)]] with individual [[Variables|Variable (Predicate Logic)]] and no [[Quantifier|Quantifier (Predicate Logic)]].

Since the variables can be anything, and are not bound with any [[Quantifiers|Quantifier (Predicate Logic)]], a [[Statement Function]] by itself does not carry any concrete meaning, unlike a [[Statement|Statement (Predicate Logic)]].
