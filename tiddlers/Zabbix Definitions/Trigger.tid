A logical expression that defines a problem threshold and is used to “evaluate” data received in [[items|Zabbix Definitions/Item]].

When received data are above the threshold, [[triggers|Zabbix Definitions/Trigger]] go from `Ok` into a `Problem` state. When received data are below the threshold, [[triggers|Zabbix Definitions/Trigger]] stay in/return to an `Ok` state.
