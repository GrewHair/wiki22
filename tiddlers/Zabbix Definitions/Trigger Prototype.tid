A [[trigger|Zabbix Definitions/Trigger]] with certain parameters as variables, ready for [[low-level discovery|Zabbix Definitions/Low-level Discovery]]. After [[low-level discovery|Zabbix Definitions/Low-level Discovery]] the variables are automatically substituted with the real discovered parameters and the trigger automatically starts evaluating data.

Prototypes of some other Zabbix entities are also in use in [[low-level discovery|Zabbix Definitions/Low-level Discovery]] - graph prototypes, host prototypes, host group prototypes.
