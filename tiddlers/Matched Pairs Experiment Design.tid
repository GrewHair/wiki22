In the [[Matched Pairs|Matched Pairs Experiment Design]] setting one performs an [[Experiment]] twice, and for the second time he literally switches the [[Control|Control Group]] and [[Treatment|Tratement Group]] groups - i.e. puts exactly the same group of individuals into the opposite group.

This technique helps mitigate the unwanted effects of [[Confounding Variables|Confounding]] that have been not accounted for/expected.
