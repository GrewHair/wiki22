A [[Path]] is a [[finite|Finite Set]] or [[infinite|Infinite Set]] [[Sequence]] of [[Edges|Edge (Graph Theory)]] which joins a [[Sequence]] of [[Vertices|Vertex (Graph Theory)]].

By most definitions, all the [[Vertices|Vertex (Graph Theory)]] in the [[Sequence]] are distinct (and thus, so are the [[Edges|Edge (Graph Theory)]]).
