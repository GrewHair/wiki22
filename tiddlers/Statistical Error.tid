''AKA Disturbance''

A [[Statistical Error]] is the amount by which an [[Observation]] differs from its //true// [[Expected Value|Expectation]]/[[Population Mean]].

Since the [[Expected Value|Expectation]]/[[Population Mean]] is usually an unobservable [[Parameter|Statistical Parameter]], the [[Statistical Error]] is also an unobservable quantity.

A [[Deviation|Deviation (Statistics)]] is called an [[Error|Statistical Error]] when it has been calculated outside of the [[Sample|Sample (Statistics)]] that was used for estimation.
