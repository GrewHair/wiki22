''Q: Hi! What's the best way to watch files in a certain directory for changes on linux?''

There are a few different ways to watch files in a directory for changes on Linux:

`inotifywait`: This is a command-line utility that comes with the inotify-tools package, which you can install using your package manager (e.g. apt-get install inotify-tools on Debian-based systems). You can use inotifywait to monitor a directory for specific file events (e.g. modification, deletion, etc.) and execute a command when one of those events occurs. For example:

```bash
inotifywait -m -r /path/to/directory -e modify | while read file; do
    echo "File $file was modified!"
done
```
`incron`: This is a daemon that allows you to specify commands to execute when certain file events occur. You can use it to monitor a directory for changes and execute a command when a change is detected. You'll need to install the incron package and then set up an incrontab to specify the directories you want to monitor and the commands you want to run.

`fswatch`: This is a command-line utility that can be used to monitor directories for changes and execute a command when a change is detected. It's available in most package repositories, so you can install it using your package manager. For example:

```bash
fswatch /path/to/directory | xargs -n1 -I{} bash -c "echo 'Directory changed: {}'"
```

`python` or `bash` script: You can also use a script written in a language like Python or Bash to monitor a directory for changes. One way to do this is to use the inotify module in Python, or the inotifywait command in a Bash script. The script can then perform some action when a change is detected.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

''Q: which of these tools can be conveniently run in the background/as daemons so I don't have to worry about a process dying?''

All of the tools that I mentioned can be run in the background, either as a daemon or as a background process. Here's how you can run each of them in the background:

inotifywait: You can use the & operator to run inotifywait in the background. For example:
Copy code
inotifywait -m -r /path/to/directory -e modify &
incron: incron is designed to run as a daemon in the background. Once you have installed the incron package and set up your incrontab, you can start the incrond daemon using the service command. For example:
Copy code
service incrond start
fswatch: You can use the & operator to run fswatch in the background. For example:
Copy code
fswatch /path/to/directory | xargs -n1 -I{} bash -c "echo 'Directory changed: {}'" &
python or bash script: If you are using a script written in a language like Python or Bash to monitor a directory for changes, you can use the nohup command to run the script in the background. For example:
Copy code
nohup /path/to/script.sh &

how do I configure incron to watch a whole directory for changes and simply log the changes to a file?
To configure incron to watch a directory for changes and log the changes to a file, you'll need to do the following:

Install the incron package:
Copy code
apt-get install incron
Edit the incrontab file to specify the directories you want to watch and the commands you want to run when changes are detected. The incrontab file is located in the /var/spool/incron directory. You can edit it using the incrontab -e command.

In the incrontab file, specify the directory you want to watch and the command you want to run when changes are detected. The syntax for an incrontab entry is as follows:

Copy code
<directory> <event> <command>
The <directory> is the path to the directory you want to watch, the <event> is the file event you want to monitor (e.g. IN_MODIFY for file modifications), and the <command> is the command you want to run when the event occurs.

To log the changes to a file, you can use the >> operator to append the output of the <command> to a file. For example, to watch the /path/to/directory directory for file modifications and log the changes to a file called /var/log/directory_changes.log, you could use the following incrontab entry:

Copy code
/path/to/directory IN_MODIFY echo "$@/$#" >> /var/log/directory_changes.log
This will log the name of the modified file and the directory it is in to the directory_changes.log file.

Save the incrontab file and start the incrond daemon using the service command:
Copy code
service incrond start
This will start the incrond daemon and begin monitoring the specified directory for changes. Whenever a file is modified in the directory, the echo command will be executed and the output will be appended to the directory_changes.log file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

ok, and how do i set the <event> to all?
To set the <event> to all, you can use the IN_ALL_EVENTS event. This will cause the <command> to be executed whenever any file event occurs in the specified <directory>.

For example, to watch the /path/to/directory directory for all file events and log the changes to a file called /var/log/directory_changes.log, you could use the following incrontab entry:

Copy code
/path/to/directory IN_ALL_EVENTS echo "$@/$#" >> /var/log/directory_changes.log
This will log the name of the file and the directory it is in, as well as the event that occurred (e.g. IN_MODIFY for file modifications), to the directory_changes.log file whenever any file event occurs in the /path/to/directory directory.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

and what would the simplest <command> that just logs the event look like?
The simplest <command> that just logs the event would be a command that writes the event to a file.

For example, to watch the /path/to/directory directory for all file events and log the events to a file called /var/log/directory_events.log, you could use the following incrontab entry:

Copy code
/path/to/directory IN_ALL_EVENTS echo "$@/$#" >> /var/log/directory_events.log
This will log the name of the file and the directory it is in, as well as the event that occurred (e.g. IN_MODIFY for file modifications), to the directory_events.log file whenever any file event occurs in the /path/to/directory directory.

If you only want to log the event, and not the name of the file or directory, you can use the following incrontab entry:

Copy code
/path/to/directory IN_ALL_EVENTS echo "$#" >> /var/log/directory_events.log
This will log the event (e.g. IN_MODIFY) to the directory_events.log file whenever any file event occurs in the /path/to/directory directory.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
