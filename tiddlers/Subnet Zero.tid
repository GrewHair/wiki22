''AKA All-zeros Subnet''

This seems to have been a thing back when subnetting was already used, but [[CIDR|Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] and [[VLSM|Variable-length Subnet Masking]] were not with us.

Basically, it's easy to confuse `10.0.0.0/24` with `10.0.0.0/8`.

And so the first subnet of all subnets a network would be split into would be dropped to avoid this confusion (dropped means you can't assign an IP from that range to a host) + they thought they'd come up with a useful function for which this first subnet could be reserved for (fast-forward to today: they haven't, and all this stuff is irrelevant).

There's also an [[All-ones Subnet]], which is an opposite to this one. It was also supposed to be dropped because its [[Broadcast Address]] could easily be confused with that of the "mother" network (misconfiguring this baby could lead to some epic ddosing lol). Also obsolete.
