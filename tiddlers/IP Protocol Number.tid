[[IP Protocol Number]] is the numeric identification of the upper layer protocol that an [[IP Packet]] should be sent to.

[[The number|IP Protocol Number]] is stored in the [[header|IP Header]] that is prefixed to  an [[IP Packet]].

In [[IPv4]], this field is called //Protocol//, in [[IPv6]] it's called //Next Header//.

Note that the [[IP Protocol Number]] is not the same as the [[port number|Port (Networking)]], which refers to a higher level (e.g. [[application|Application Layer]]) layer. So, [[IP Protocol Number]] is like an analog of port number, but one layer lower.
