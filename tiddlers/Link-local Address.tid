[[Link-local Addresses|Link-local Address]] today are normally only used as a last resort, when no static [[IP Address]] is configured and the [[DHCP|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] [[server|Server]] is down.

It is a static, [[Peer to Peer]] (as contrasted with the [[Client-Server|Client-Server Model]] approach of [[DHCP|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]]) method which presumably will work in all cases because it has no single point of failure like a [[DHCP|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] [[server|Server]].

Like [[Private Addresses|Private Address]], these are not [[routed|Routing]] in the [[Internet]]. However, they are held distinct from the [[Private Address]] [[space|Address Space]] in order to never conflict with it (e.g. if a [[DHCP|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] [[server|Server]] goes down, and then recovers after some time).

Usually when one notices that a device's [[IP Address]] is a [[Link-local Address]], it is an indicator that something is wrong: either a static [[IP|IP Address]] is not configured, or a [[DHCP|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] [[server|Server]] is down.

Windows calls this crap APIPA...

Also, all of this applies mainly only to [[IPv4]]. In [[IPv6]] all of this works really differently, and a lot of protocols actually __rely__ on [[Link-local Addresses|Link-local Address]] there, instead of ignoring them like [[IPv4]] effectively does.
