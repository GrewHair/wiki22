''AKA Basic NAT, Static NAT''

[[Basic NAT|One-to-one NAT]] is the simplest type of [[NAT|Network Address Translation]].

It provides a one-to-one translation of [[IP Addresses|IP Address]].

In this type of [[NAT|Network Address Translation]], only the [[IP Addresses|IP Address]], [[IP Header|IPv4 Header]] [[Checksum]], and any higher-level [[checksums|Checksum]] that include the [[IP Address]] are changed.

[[Basic NAT|One-to-one NAT]] can be used to interconnect two [[IP|Internet Protocol]] networks that have incompatible addressing.

Today, it is not what people usually mean when they mention [[NAT|Network Address Translation]] :)
