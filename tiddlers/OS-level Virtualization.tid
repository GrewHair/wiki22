[[OS-level Virtualization]] is an [[Operating System]] paradigm in which the [[Kernel]] allows the existence of multiple isolated [[User Space]] instances, usually called [[Containers|Container]].

Thus, with [[OS-level Virtualization]], all the instances/[[Containers|Container]] must share a single [[Kernel]], but may differ in [[User Space]] (e.g. different [[Linux]] distributions with the same [[Kernel]]).
