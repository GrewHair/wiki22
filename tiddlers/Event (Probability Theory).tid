An [[Event|Event (Probability Theory)]] is a [[Subset]] of the [[Sample Space]].

In cases when the [[Sample Space]]
 is not [[finite|Finite Set]], it is more correct to say that an [[Event|Event (Probability Theory)]] is an element of the [[Ïƒ-algebra]] of [[subsets|Subset]] of the [[Sample Space]].

It should be stressed that an [[Event]] is a [[Set]]. E.g.:

$$
\{\omega \in \Omega | u < X(\omega) \leq v \},
$$

where $$X(\omega)$$ is a [[Random Variable]].

From this it is clear that the [[Event|Event (Probability Theory)]] that a [[Random Variable]] $$X$$ takes on a value in range $$(u, v]$$ is really an [[Inverse Image|Inverse Image of a Set]] of $$(u, v]$$ under $$X$$.

However, they are often written as [[predicates|Predicate (Predicate Logic)]] or [[indicators|Indicator Function]] involving [[Random Variables|Random Variable]]. E.g.:

$$
u < X(\omega) \leq v.
$$

Thus, the common notation for [[Probability]]

$$
P(u < X \leq v) = F(v) - F(u)
$$

is really a shorthand for

$$
P(\{\omega \in \Omega | u < X \leq v \}) = F(v) - F(u)
$$
