[[Supervised Learning]] can be framed as a conditional probability problem - and thus e.g. [[Maximum Likelihood Estimation]] can be used to fit a [[Model|Model (Machine Learning)]] that best summarizes the [[Conditional Probability Distribution]] (of $$y$$ given $$X$$) - the so-called [[Conditional Maximum Likelihood Estimation]].
