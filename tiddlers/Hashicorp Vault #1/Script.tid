''Q: can you write a sample bash command that would go through all the files in a directory, base64-encode them and store in hashicorp vault?''

Sure, here is an example of a bash command that goes through all the files in a directory, base64-encodes them, and stores them in Hashicorp Vault:

```bash
for file in /path/to/directory/*; do
  # Check if the file is a binary file
  if file --mime-type "$file" | grep -q "application/octet-stream"; then
    # Base64 encode the file
    encoded_file=$(base64 "$file")
    # Store the encoded file in Vault
    vault kv put secret/your-secret-path "$(basename "$file")"="$encoded_file"
  fi
done
```

This command will go through all the files in the directory specified by `/path/to/directory/` and check if the file is binary or not by using the file command, if file is binary then it will be base64 encoded and then stored in the specific path specified in the command `vault kv put secret/your-secret-path`.

Please note that this is just a basic example, in real-world scenario you would probably want to add error handling, and also you should adjust the command to use the auth method of your choice (token,approle,ldap,etc) and also adapt it to your specific needs.

Also, Keep in mind that if you are working with large files, you may want to consider storing them on a remote file system and storing a reference to the file in Vault instead.

''Q: can it be made more concise? ideally one-liner''

Yes, it is possible to make the command more concise by combining the commands into a single line, here's an example of a one-liner command that does the same thing:

```bash
find /path/to/directory -type f -exec sh -c 'file --mime-type "$1" | grep -q "application/octet-stream" && echo "$1" | base64 | vault kv put secret/your-secret-path "$(basename "$1")"=' _ {} \;
```

This command uses find command to look for all files under directory specified by `/path/to/directory` and for each file it runs an inner shell command (indicated by `-exec sh -c`), in which it checks if the file is binary or not by using the file command, if file is binary then it will be base64 encoded and then stored in the specific path specified in the command `vault kv put secret/your-secret-path "$(basename "$1")"=`.

This command is more concise, but it might be harder to read and understand because it combines multiple commands together. Additionally, it's important to note that with one-liner command if any error occurs in the inner shell command it will not break the loop, So it is difficult to track down the error.

Keep in mind that this is just an example, in real-world scenario you would probably want to add error handling, and also you should adjust the command to use the auth method of your choice (token,approle,ldap,etc) and also adapt it to your specific needs.

''Q: does the `vault` cli tool have any flags/options that do the base64 encoding?''

No, the vault command line interface (CLI) tool does not have any built-in flags or options for base64 encoding data before it is stored in Hashicorp Vault. However, the CLI tool does have the ability to read data from a file, so you can base64 encode the file first before storing it in Vault.

Here's an example of how you could use the vault CLI tool to base64 encode a file and then store it in Vault:

```bash
base64 /path/to/file | vault kv put secret/your-secret-path "$(basename /path/to/file)"=-
```

This command first base64 encodes the file using the base64 command, then pipes the encoded output to the vault CLI tool, which is used to store the encoded data in the specified secret path.

It's worth noting that Vault supports base64 decoding by default for string data during retrieval time. This means when you retrieve the secrets via vault CLI or API, the content of the secret will be automatically base64 decoded and returned to you in original format, This allow you to store it as a base64 encoded string and retrieve it in its original format.

Additionally, you can also use programming languages such as Python, Go, etc to write a script that will first base64 encode the file and then store it in Vault using Vault's API.

''Q: can this last command line be rewritten to operate on all the files in a directory instead of just one?''

Yes, it is possible to modify the last command line to operate on all the files in a directory. You can use the find command to locate all the files in the specified directory, and then use -exec option to execute the base64 and vault commands on each file.

Here is an example of how you can modify the last command line to operate on all the files in a directory:

```bash
find /path/to/directory -type f -exec sh -c 'base64 "$1" | vault kv put secret/your-secret-path "$(basename "$1")"=-' _ {} \;
```

This command uses find command to look for all files under directory specified by `/path/to/directory` and for each file it runs an inner shell command (indicated by `-exec sh -c`) and execute the base64 and vault command to base64 encode the file and store it in the vault.

It's important to note that this command is similar to the previous one-liner command that I showed earlier, but it's a bit more efficient and it will process all files in the directory, this can be useful if you have many files that you want to store in vault and you don't want to process them one by one.

As before, it's important to note that this command assumes that your vault server is already running and you are already authenticated, otherwise you would need to include authentication step before this command.

''Q: can it be done without using `find`? maybe with `xargs`?''

Yes, it is also possible to operate on all files in a directory without using find, one option could be using the ls command to list the files in the specified directory and xargs command to execute the base64 and vault command on each file.

Here's an example of how you can use ls and xargs to base64 encode all files in a directory and store them in Vault:

```bash
ls /path/to/directory | xargs -I {} sh -c 'base64 "/path/to/directory/{}" | vault kv put secret/your-secret-path "{}"=-'
```

This command lists the files in the directory `/path/to/directory` using the ls command and then uses xargs to execute a shell command on each file, the shell command run base64 command to encode the file, and then vault command to store the encoded file in the specified secret path with the filename as the key.

It's worth noting that this command might not be suitable for all cases, if filenames contain spaces or any other special characters the command may break, it's always a good idea to test the command with a small set of files before running it on a large number of files.

Also, like previously, it's important to note that this command assumes that your vault server is already running and you are already authenticated, otherwise you would need to include authentication step before this command.

''Q: how about something like `base64 ./* | vault kv put secret/your-secret-path`? would that work?''

The command you've proposed `base64 ./* | vault kv put secret/your-secret-path` would not work as expected. The base64 command will encode all files in the current directory (indicated by `./*`) and write the encoded output to standard output, this would mean that all the files would be concatenated and stored in Vault as a single value, with a single key (`your-secret-path`) in this case, so you would only be able to retrieve the last file encoded, and you would lose the other files.

Also, it is important to note that it will not store each file with its corresponding name, so you wouldn't be able to know which file is which, this means that it will make the retrieval process quite complicated and hard to track.

If you want to encode all files in the current directory and store them individually in Vault, you need to specify each file name as key and the base64 encoded data as value, as I've shown in previous examples, as well as use a loop, find, or xargs command to go through each file individually.
