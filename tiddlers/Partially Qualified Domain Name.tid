''AKA Relative Domain Name''

In contrast with [[FQDN|Fully Qualified Domain Name]], a [[Partially Qualified Domain Name]] does not include all labels to the [[DNS Root|Root Domain Zone]].

These are often simply [[Hostnames|Hostname]], i.e. the left-most label in an [[FQDN|Fully Qualified Domain Name]].
