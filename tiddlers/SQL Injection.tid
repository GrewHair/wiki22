[[Servers|Server]] are usually supported by [[Databases|Database]] that are accessed through a standard interface called [[SQL|SQL]].

One frequent attack is called [[SQL Injection]]. If access is not carefully circumscribed, a clever attacker can submit queries to obtain information about the [[Database]] structure, extract unauthorized information, and even run the attacker's code on the [[Server]].
