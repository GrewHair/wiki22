''AKA SAST''

[[Static Application Security Testing]] is reviewing the [[Source Code]] of the software to identify sources of vulnerabilities.

The process of statically analyzing the source code has been around as long as computers have existed, but it spread to the [[Security]] realm in the late 90s, when issues like [[SQL Injection]] first came into being and technologies like [[JavaScript]] and [[Flash]] emerged.

Unlike [[DAST|Dynamic Application Security Testing]] tools, which mainly focus on [[Black-box Testing]], [[SAST|Static Application Security Testing]] tools focus on the code content of the application (i.e. [[White-box Testing]]).

A [[SAST|Static Application Security Testing]] tool scans the [[Source Code]] of applications and its components to identify potential security vulnerabilities in their architecture. It can detect an estimated 50% of existing security vulnerabilities.
