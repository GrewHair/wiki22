Frustratingly enough, in all major [[Java]] versions up to and including [[Java 8]] the command `java --version` resulted in an error. You had to use `java -version` instead, which kind of goes against standard [[Unix]]/[[Linux]] conventions.

However this seems to be fixed since [[Java 11]], now you can use both variants.
