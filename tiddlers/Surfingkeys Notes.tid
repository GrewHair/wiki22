* some sites are hell bent on sending you to insert mode - like, say, chatgpt. gotta do something about that
** on the flip side, sk is pretty aggressive with not letting them do that too. e.g. on jenkins page i can't search with ctrl-k because of that
* ace editor freaks out from time to time
** disappears when i leave and revisit the tab
** exits without actually pasting the damn content
*** hacked together a solution already (it also involves copyq)
** sometimes it just disappears without warning, rhyme or reason (at least at chatgpt)
* handling of function keys beyond f12 could really be better
** normal mode just ignores them so they propagate to browser
** insert mode not only ignores them, but for some reason they even can't propagate at all
* codemirror in tiddlywiki completely dominates surfingkeys.. no mappings work, doesn't matter the mode
*..

* you can use dot and numbers with `gu`
* you can use dot with hinting actions with highly specific selectors (broad selectors yield unpredictable results tho)

https://wise.com/ (as of 2025-17-10, [[snapshot attempt|https://web.archive.org/web/20251011123759/https://wise.com/us/account/]]) has a "features" button up top. you can't click it with normal vimium's hints. but it does throw a dropdown when hovered over. try out surfingkeys' "mouse out" thingie on it.
