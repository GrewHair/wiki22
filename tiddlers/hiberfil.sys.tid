[[hiberfil.sys]] is a file the [[Windows|Microsoft Windows]] uses to store a copy of [[RAM]] when the machine goes to hibernation.

If you're short on [[Hard Disk|Hard Disk Drive]] space, it's important to remember that you better keep at least as much free space as you have [[RAM]], because otherwise this goddamn file will make you cry!
